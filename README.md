# CustomerData_Clustering
Customer Segmentation based on credit card information Using Unsuprvised learning

In this project, I will be performing some unsupervised clustering algorithms on the sample Dataset that summarizes the usage behavior of 8950 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. Customer segmentation helps to optimize the significance of each customer to the business, Modify products according to the distinct needs and behaviors of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.
